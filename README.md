For example to to save a note, a user will have to make a POST request to the https://faithful-beret-boa.cyclic.app/note/post route of which the body of the request must contain  title and content respectively together with the bearer token as Authorization. To get all previousely saved notes, a user will have to make a GET request to https://faithful-beret-boa.cyclic.app/note/posts route with Token generated after login as bearer authorization.

To update a note, a user will have to make a PUT request to https://faithful-beret-boa.cyclic.app/note/update/:postId route with postId as a param and body will contain title and content you wish to update the note with together with the Token generated at login as Authorization. To DELETE a note, a user will have to visit the https://faithful-beret-boa.cyclic.app/note/post/postId with authorization token and the note of which the id is used as param ie postId will be deleted. 
    It should be noted that a user cannot perform any of the CRUD operation on a note he or she did not create e.g user A cannot delete or update a note user B created and vice versa.
